        'With the help of a touch of flour and water, our kids had a blast playing with clay. The younger ones had a chance to stimulate their senses. We showed them to sink their little hands into the dough, watched them smile with the wetness, and let them have a chance to exercise their fine movement abilities. The older ones built it all, from snakes and hipos, to castles and frisbees. The only sad part was having to clean up afterwards!',

Everyone jumped enthusiastically to defeat the villain, and took turns making the weirdest faces they could come up with. But no one wanted to remain sit when the music came on between chapters.',
