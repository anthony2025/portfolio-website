        'With the help of a touch of flour and water, our kids had a blast playing with clay. The younger ones had a chance to stimulate their senses. We showed them to sink their little hands into the dough, watched them smile with the wetness, and let them have a chance to exercise their fine movement abilities. The older ones built it all, from snakes and hipos, to castles and frisbees. The only sad part was having to clean up afterwards!',

        'Lights, Camera, Action! With no choreography but a lot of swing, our kids played in their own musical. Ms. Fabiola narrated, and the kids took the chance to dress up and take improv acting.
