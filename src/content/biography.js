export default `I started experimenting with computers while I was a kid in Peru, playing with logo turtle graphics and dissasembling toasters.

Fast forward to 2015, and I was studying Computer Science at University of Virginia, building projects in Android for school, and experimenting with NodeJS on my free time.

After college, I've successfully crafted and deployed a marketing website with React/Redux, and built a myriad of side projects to teach myself web technologies across the whole web stack.

Currently I'm experimenting with GraphQL and Apollo, and helping with translations of open source software. I am looking to join a team of motivated engineers where I can use my abilities on a bigger scale.`
