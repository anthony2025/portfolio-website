export default `I started experimenting with computers while I was a kid in Peru, playing with logo turtle graphics and dissasembling toasters.

Fast forward to 2015, I was studying Computer Science at University of Virginia, building projects in Android for school, and experimenting with NodeJS on my free time.

After college, I've successfully crafted and deployed a responsive marketing website with React/Redux, and built a myriad of side projects to teach myself web technologies across the whole web stack.

Currently I'm experimenting with GraphQL in Relay, and helping with translations of open source. I am looking to join a team of very motivated individuals where I can use my abilities on a bigger scale.

Ps: I'm the handsome individual in the middle.`
