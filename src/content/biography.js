export default `My journey in web dev started when I was a kid in Peru, playing with turtle graphics and electronics, back in the 90's. Fast forward to 2015, and I was studying Computer Science at University of Virginia, building projects in Android/Java for school, and experimenting with Javasript and Ruby.

After college I decided to get a headstart on my career, and have spent this past year building projects around the whole web stack.

I've successfully crafted and deployed a responsive marketing website, to help my clients with marketing efforts and client retention. Currently I'm experimenting with GraphQL, using Apollo/Relay, and helping with translations of open source.

At the moment I am looking to join a highly motivated team where I can use my abilities to help on a bigger scale project.
