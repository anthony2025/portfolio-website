export default `Welcome!

Pardon the giant flashy name. I am a Full Stack Developer, currently living in Alexandria, VA. I focus in working with React and the Node ecosystem to build data-driven, responsive websites (like this one).

My main quality is a never ending, insatiable desire to learn. I have successfully taught myself a large gamut of web technologies in record time, and never stop in my quest to keep learning more every.single.day.

If my work interests you please feel free to reach out, I would love to learn more about what you are up to.

Have a great day and stay awesome.
